### Hi there 👋

I am a DevOps engineer based in Germany. Working mostly on edge systems (Varnish, HAProxy, WAF) and supporting software. Most of the time I code in Go, Python and Rust!

- 🔭 I’m currently working on [Varnish](https://varnish-cache.com) related projects
- 💬 Ask me about cloud, monitoring and alerting, the ELK stack and safe deployment techniques
